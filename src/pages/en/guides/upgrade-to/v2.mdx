This guide will help you migrate from Astro v1 to Astro v2.

Need to upgrade an older project to v1? See our [older migration guide](https://github.com/withastro/docs/blob/aa7e4f568f418657eba297778729a8aee2a36409/src/pages/en/migrate.mdx).

## Upgrade Astro

1. You can check your version of Astro, and any official Astro integrations (`@astrojs/*`), in `package.json` at the root of your project. These may be in `devDependencies` and/or `dependencies`:

    ```json "@astrojs/" {7}
    //package.json
    "devDependencies": {
      "@astrojs/react": "^1.2.2",
      "@astrojs/svelte": "^1.0.2",
      "@astropub/icons": "^0.1.1",
      "accessible-astro-components": "^1.4.5",
      "astro": "1.9.2",
      "react": "^18.2.0",
      "react-dom": "^18.0.0",
      "svelte": "^3.47.0"
    },
    "dependencies": {
      "@astrojs/image": "0.13.0-beta.0",
      "@astrojs/rss": "^2.0.0",
      "@astrojs/vue": "^1.2.1",
      "vue": "^3.2.41"
    }
    ```

2. Update your project's version of Astro to the latest version using your package manager. If you're using Astro integrations, please also update those to the latest version.

    <PackageManagerTabs>
      <Fragment slot="npm">
      ```shell
      # upgrades to Astro v2.x:
      npm install astro@latest
      ```
      </Fragment>
      <Fragment slot="pnpm">
      ```shell
      # upgrades to Astro v2.x:
      pnpm install astro@latest
      ```
      </Fragment>
      <Fragment slot="yarn">
      ```shell
      # upgrades to Astro v2.x:
      yarn add astro@latest
      ```
      </Fragment>
    </PackageManagerTabs>

3. Check that you are running **at least Node `16.12.0`**. In v2.0, Astro dropped support for Node `14`.

    ```sh
    node -v
    ```
    
    If necessary, [update your version of Node](#removed-support-for-node-14) in your local and deployment environments.

## Update your code

Many projects will not need any changes to the codebase. Your upgrade may now be complete! But, this upgrade does bring some breaking changes:

- **the complete removal of several previously-deprecated items**

  Still using one of the [deprecated options mentioned below](#astro-20-breaking-changes)? Replace them with their current equivalent!

- **a new, unified location for your built assets**

  Have a [deploy config that depends on chunks](#added-_astro-folder-for-build-assets)? See where your built assets are now!

- **a redesign of Markdown and MDX plugin configuration**

  Using plugins in [Markdown](#changed-markdown-plugin-configuration) and [MDX](#changed-mdx-plugin-configuration)? Convert your config with our updated flags!

- **a new, reserved folder `src/content/` for the new Collections API**

  Have [an existing folder called `src/content/`](#reserved-srccontent)? Rename it to avoid conflicts!

- **three exciting features that are no longer experimental**

  You [no longer need these flags](#astro-20-experimental-flags-removed) to get the goodies. Remove them from your Astro configuration!

If your project doesn't work as expected after upgrading to v2.0, then check this guide for major highlights and instructions on how to handle breaking changes when upgrading from v1.x and v2.0-beta releases. 

See [the changelog](https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/main/packages/astro/CHANGELOG.md) for full release notes.


## Astro 2.0 Breaking Changes

### Updated: Vite 4

Astro v2.0 upgrades from Vite 3 to [Vite 4](https://vitejs.dev/), released in December 2022.

#### What should I do?

There should be no changes to your code necessary! Enjoy [many internal improvements under the hood](https://vitejs.dev/blog/announcing-vite4.html), without changing a thing.

We've handled most of the upgrade for you inside of Astro; however, some subtle Vite behaviors may still change between versions. 

Refer to the official [Vite Migration Guide](https://vitejs.dev/guide/migration.html) if you run into trouble.

### Removed: Support for Node 14

Node 14 is scheduled to reach its End of Life in April 2023. 

Astro 2.0 drops Node 14 support entirely, so that all Astro users can take advantage of Node's more modern features.

#### What should I do?

 Check that both your development environment and your deployment environment are using **Node.js `16.12.0` or later**.

1. Check your local version of node using:

    ```sh
    node -v
 
    ```
    If your local development environment needs upgrading, [install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).


2. Check your [deployment environment's](/en/guides/deploy/) own documentation to verify that they support Node 16. 

    You can specify Node `16.12.0` for your Astro project either in a dashboard configuration setting, or a `.nvmrc` file.


### Removed: `legacy.astroFlavoredMarkdown`

In 1.0, Astro moved the old Astro Flavored Markdown (also known as Components in Markdown) to a legacy feature. 

Astro 2.0 removes the `legacy.astroFlavoredMarkdown` option completely. Importing and using components in `.md` files will no longer work.

#### What should I do?

Remove this legacy flag. It is no longer available in Astro.

```js del={3-5}
// astro.config.mjs
export default defineConfig({
	legacy: {
		astroFlavoredMarkdown: true,
	},
})

```

If you were using this feature in 1.x, we recommend [using the MDX integration](/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/) which allows you to include components and JSX expressions in your Markdown.

See our older upgrade guide for more about [converting existing Markdown files to MDX](https://github.com/withastro/docs/blob/aa7e4f568f418657eba297778729a8aee2a36409/src/pages/en/migrate.mdx#converting-existing-md-files-to-mdx).

### Removed: `Astro.resolve()`

In 0.24, Astro deprecated `Astro.resolve()` for getting resolved URLs to assets that you might want to reference in the browser.

Astro 2.0 removes this option entirely. `Astro.resolve()` in your code will cause an error.

#### What should I do?

Resolve asset paths using `import` instead. For example:

```astro
// src/pages/index.astro
---
import 'style.css';
import imageUrl from './image.png';
---

<img src={imageUrl} />
```

See the [v0.24 upgrade guide](https://github.com/withastro/docs/blob/aa7e4f568f418657eba297778729a8aee2a36409/src/pages/en/migrate.mdx#deprecated-astroresolve) for more information.

### Removed: `Astro.fetchContent()`

In 0.26, Astro deprecated `Astro.fetchContent()`for fetching data from your local Markdown files.

Astro 2.0 removes this option entirely. `Astro.fetchContent()` in your code will cause an error.

#### What should I do?

Use [`Astro.glob()`](/en/guides/imports/#astroglob) to fetch Markdown files, or convert to the [Content Collections](/en/guides/content-collections/) feature.

```astro
// src/pages/index.astro
---
let allPosts = await Astro.glob('./posts/*.md');
---
```

### Removed: `Astro.canonicalURL`

In 1.0, Astro deprecated `Astro.canonicalURL` for constructing a canonical URL. 


Astro 2.0 removes this option entirely. `Astro.canonicalURL()` in your code will cause an error.

#### What should I do?

Use `Astro.url` to construct a canonical URL.

```astro
// src/pages/index.astro
---
const canonicalURL = new URL(Astro.url.pathname, Astro.site);
---

```

### Added: `_astro/` folder for build assets

In 1.0, assets were built to various locations, including `assets/`, `chunks/` and the root of the build output.

Astro 2.0 moves and unifies the location of all build output assets to a new `_astro/` folder. 

<FileTree>
- dist/
  - _astro
    - client.9218e799.js
    - index.df3f880e0.css
</FileTree>

You can control this location with the [new `build.assets` configuration option](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#buildassets).

#### What should I do?

Update your configuration with your deployment platform if your deployment relies on the location of these assets. 


### Changed: Markdown plugin configuration

#### Removed: `extendDefaultPlugins`

Astro 2.0 removes `markdown.extendDefaultPlugins` for controlling Astro's default plugin behavior when adding your own plugins. 

Applying remark and rehype plugins in your Markdown configuration  **no longer disables Astro's default plugins**, so this option is no longer needed.

GitHub-Flavored Markdown and Smartypants are now applied whether or not custom `remarkPlugins` or `rehypePlugins` are configured. (You can opt out manually by setting the [new `gfm` and `smartypants` options](#added-gfm-and-smartypants) to `false` in your config.)


##### What should I do?

Remove `extendDefaultPlugins: true` in your configuration. This is now Astro's default behavior in 2.0, and you can delete this line without any replacement.

```js del={6}
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
  markdown: {
    extendDefaultPlugins: true,
  }
});
```

#### Added: `gfm` and `smartypants`

Astro 2.0 replaces `markdown.extendDefaultPlugins` with separate Boolean options to control each of Astro's built-in default Markdown plugins individually. These are enabled by default, and can be set to `false` to remove each plugin independently.

##### What should I do?

Replace `extendDefaultPlugins: false` and add the flags to disable each plugin individually instead.

- `markdown.gfm: false` disables GitHub-Flavored Markdown
- `markdown.smartypants: false` disables SmartyPants

```js del={6} ins={7-8}
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
  markdown: {
    extendDefaultPlugins: false,
    smartypants: false,
    gfm: false,
  }
});
```

### Changed: MDX plugin configuration

#### Replaced: `extendPlugins` -> `extendMarkdownConfig`

In 1.0, `.mdx.extendPlugins` managed how your MDX files should inherit your Markdown plugin configuration. This setting was used to indicate whether all Markdown plugins (`markdown`), or only Astro's default plugins (`defaults`) should be applied to MDX.

Astro 2.0 replaces `mdx.extendPlugins` with three new, independently-configurable options:

- **[`mdx.extendMarkdownConfig`](/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/#extendmarkdownconfig)** (`true` by default) to inherit all of your Markdown configuration or none of it.
- **`mdx.gfm`** (`true` by default) to enable or disable GitHub-Flavored Markdown in MDX.
- **`mdx.smartypants`** (`true` by default) to enable or disable SmartyPants in MDX.

 ##### What should I do?

Delete `extendPlugins: 'markdown'` in your configuration. This is now default behavior. 

```js del={6}
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
  mdx: {
    extendPlugins: markdown,
  }
});
```

Replace `extendPlugins: 'defaults'` with `extendMarkdownConfig: false` and add the [separate options for GitHub-Flavored Markdown and SmartyPants](/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/#options-inherited-from-markdown-config) to enable these default plugins individually in MDX.

```js del={6} ins={7-9}
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
  mdx: {
    extendPlugins: defaults,
    extendMarkdownConfig: false,
    smartypants: true,
    gfm: true,
  }
});
```

#### Added: More MDX config options to match Markdown

Setting `extendMarkdownConfig: false` now allows you to individually set [every available Markdown configuration option](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#markdown-options) (except `drafts`) separately in your MDX integration configuration.

```js
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import mdx from '@astrojs/mdx';

export default defineConfig({
  markdown: {
    syntaxHighlight: 'prism',
    remarkPlugins: [remarkPlugin1],
    gfm: true,
  },
  integrations: [
    mdx({
      // `syntaxHighlight` inherited from Markdown

      // Markdown `remarkPlugins` ignored,
      // only `remarkPlugin2` applied.
      remarkPlugins: [remarkPlugin2],
      // `gfm` overridden to `false`
      gfm: false,
    })
  ]
});
```

##### What should I do?

Revisit your Markdown and MDX configuration and compare your existing config with the new options available.

:::tip[remember]
- Astro's two default Markdown plugins are now individually configurable, and are not removed when you add other plugins. No more extending defaults!
- The option to extend your Markdown plugin config to MDX has moved from a selection (just defaults or all plugins) to toggle (all or none).
- Every Markdown config option (except drafts) can also be configured independently in MDX!
:::

### Added: Plugin access to frontmatter

In 1.0, remark and rehype plugins did not have access to user frontmatter. Astro merged plugin frontmatter with your file's frontmatter, without passing the file frontmatter to your plugins.

Astro 2.0 gives remark and rehype plugins access to user frontmatter via frontmatter injection. This allows plugin authors to modify a user's existing frontmatter, or compute new properties based on other properties.


#### What should I do?

Check any remark and rehype plugins you have written to see whether their behavior has changed. Note that `data.astro.frontmatter` is now the _complete_ Markdown or MDX document's frontmatter, rather than an empty object.

### Reserved: `src/content/`

In 1.0, the [Collections API was hidden behind an experimental flag](#content-collections). This API reserves `src/content/` as a special folder.

Astro 2.0 now includes the Collections API in the core codebase for organizing your Markdown and MDX files into [content collections](/en/guides/content-collections/).

#### What should I do?

Rename an existing `src/content/` folder to avoid conflicts. This folder, if it exists, can now only be used for [content collections](/en/guides/content-collections/).

## Astro 2.0 Experimental Flags Removed

Astro v2.0 brings some new features from experimental flags into the core codebase.

#### What should I do?

Remove the following previously-experimental flags from `astro.config.mjs`:

```js del={5-7}
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
  experimental: { contentCollections: true },
  experimental: { prerender: true },
  experimental: { error-overlay: true },
})
```

These features are now available by default:

- [Content collections](/en/guides/content-collections/) as a way to manage your Markdown and MDX files with type-safety.
- [Prerendering individual pages to static HTML]((/en/guides/server-side-rendering/#prerendering)) when using SSR to improve speed and cacheability.
- A redesigned error message overlay.
