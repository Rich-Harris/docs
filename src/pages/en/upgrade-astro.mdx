This guide will help you migrate from Astro v1 to Astro v2.

Need to upgrade an older project to v1? See our [older migration guide](https://github.com/withastro/docs/blob/aa7e4f568f418657eba297778729a8aee2a36409/src/pages/en/migrate.mdx).

## Upgrade steps

1. You can check your version of Astro, and any official Astro integrations (`@astrojs/*`), in `package.json` at the root of your project. These may be in `devDependencies` and/or `dependencies`:

  ```json "@astrojs/" {6}
  "devDependencies": {
    "@astrojs/react": "^1.2.2",
    "@astrojs/svelte": "^1.0.2",
    "@astropub/icons": "^0.1.1",
    "accessible-astro-components": "^1.4.5",
    "astro": "2.0.0-beta.0",
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.0.0",
    "svelte": "^3.47.0"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@astrojs/image": "0.13.0-beta.0",
    "@astrojs/rss": "^2.0.0",
    "@astrojs/vue": "^1.2.1",
    "vue": "^3.2.41"
  }
  ```

2. Update your project's version of Astro to the latest version using your package manager. If you're using Astro integrations, please also update those to the latest version.

  <PackageManagerTabs>
    <Fragment slot="npm">
    ```shell
    # upgrades to Astro v2.x:
    npm i astro@latest
    # to update all dependencies:
    npm upgrade
    ```
    </Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="pnpm">
    ```shell
    # upgrades to Astro v2.x:
    pnpm i astro@latest
    # to update all dependencies:
    pnpm upgrade
    ```
    </Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="yarn">
    ```shell
    # upgrades to Astro v2.x:
    yarn add astro@latest
    # to update all dependencies:
    yarn upgrade
    ```
    </Fragment>
  </PackageManagerTabs>

3. Check that you are running **at least Node `16.12.0`**. In v2.0, Astro dropped support for Node `14`:

  ```sh
  node -v
  ```
  
  If necessary, follow the instructions to [install Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) via the command line. You may also need to verify that your [deployment environment](/en/guides/deploy/) meets this new minimum standard. You may wish to create a `.nmvrc` file to specify this version.

## Do I need to update my code?

Many projects will not need any changes to the codebase! Your upgrade may now be complete.  

But, this upgrade does bring:

- **Vite 4**

  Astro *should* [handle everything](#updated-vite-4) for you under the hood!

- **the removal of several previously-deprecated flags**

  Using one of the [config options mentioned below](#astro-20-breaking-changes)? That's got to go!

- **a new, unified location for your built assets**

  Have some [deploy config that depends on chunks](#added-_astro-folder-for-build-assets)? See below!

- **a redesign of Markdown and MDX plugin configuration**

  Using plugins in [Markdown](#changed-markdown-plugin-configuration) and [MDX](#changed-mdx-plugin-configuration)? Convert your config!

- **a new, reserved folder `src/content/` for our new Collections API**

  If you [have your own folder called `src/content/`](#added-srccontent), we'd like a word with you!

- **three exciting features that are no longer experimental**

  You [don't need these flags](#astro-20-experimental-flags-removed) to get the goodies. Open to everyone now!

So if your project doesn't work as expected after upgrading to v2.0, then check this guide for major highlights and instructions on how to handle breaking changes when upgrading from v1.x and v2.0-beta releases. See [the changelog](https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/main/packages/astro/CHANGELOG.md) for full release notes.


## Astro 2.0 Updates

### Updated: Node Version >=16.12.0

The minimum supported version of NodeJS is now 16.12.0.

#### What should I check?

Both your development environment and your deployment environment must now meet this minimum standard.

1. Check your local version of node using:

    ```sh
    node -v
 
    ```
    If your local development environment needs upgrading to Node 16, [install Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) via the command line.


2. Check your [deployment environment's](/en/guides/deploy/) own documentation to verify that they support Node 16. 

    You may be able to specify Node 16.12.0 for your Astro project either in a dashboard, or a `.nvmrc` file.


### Updated: Vite 4

Astro v2.0 upgrades from Vite 3 to [Vite 4](https://vitejs.dev/). 

#### What should I do?

There should be no changes to your code necessary! Enjoy [many internal improvements under-the-hood](https://vitejs.dev/blog/announcing-vite4.html) without changing a thing.

We've handled most of the upgrade for you inside of Astro; however, some subtle Vite behaviors may still change between versions. 

Refer to the official [Vite Migration Guide](https://vitejs.dev/guide/migration.html) if you run into trouble.


## Astro 2.0 Breaking Changes

### Removed: `legacy.astroFlavoredMarkdown`

In 1.0, Astro moved the old Astro Flavored Markdown (also known as Components in Markdown) to a legacy feature. 

Astro 2.0 removes the `legacy.astroFlavoredMarkdown` option completely. Importing and using components in `.md` files will no longer work.

#### What should I do?

This legacy flag is no longer available in Astro and should be removed:

```astro del={3-5}
// astro.config.mjs
export default defineConfig({
	legacy: {
		astroFlavoredMarkdown: true,
	},

```

If you were using this feature in 1.x, we recommend [using the MDX integration](/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/) which allows you to include components and JSX expressions in your Markdown.

See our older upgrade guide for more about [converting existing Mardown files to MDX](https://github.com/withastro/docs/blob/aa7e4f568f418657eba297778729a8aee2a36409/src/pages/en/migrate.mdx#converting-existing-md-files-to-mdx).

### Removed: `Astro.resolve()`

In 0.24, Astro deprecated `Astro.resolve()` for getting resolved URLs to assets that you might want to reference in the browser.

Astro 2.0 removes this option entirely. `Astro.resolve()` in your code will cause an error.

#### What should I do?

Resolve asset paths using `import` instead. For example:

```astro
---
import 'style.css';
import imageUrl from './image.png';
---

<img src={imageUrl} />
```

See the [v0.24 upgrade guide](https://github.com/withastro/docs/blob/aa7e4f568f418657eba297778729a8aee2a36409/src/pages/en/migrate.mdx#deprecated-astroresolve) for more information.

### Removed: `Astro.fetchContent()`

In 0.26, Astro deprecated `Astro.fetchContent()`for fetching data from your local Markdown files.

Astro 2.0 removes this option entirely. `Astro.fetchContent()` in your code will cause an error.

#### What should I do?

Use [`Astro.glob()`](/en/guides/imports/#astroglob) to fetch Markdown files, or migrate to the [Content Collections](/en/guides/content-collections/) feature.

```js
let allPosts = await Astro.glob('./posts/*.md');
```

### Removed: `Astro.canonicalURL`

In 1.0, Astro deprecated `Astro.canonicalURL` for constructing a canonical URL. 


Astro 2.0 removes this option entirely. `Astro.canonicalURL()` in your code will cause an error.

#### What should I do?

Use `Astro.url` to construct the canonical URL.

```js
const canonicalURL = new URL(Astro.url.pathname, Astro.site);
```

### Added: `_astro/` folder for build assets

Astro 2.0 moves the location of all build output assets to a new `_astro/` folder. Previously, these assets were built to various locations, including `assets/`, `chunks/` and the root of the build output. 

You can control this location with the [new `build.assets` configuration option](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#buildassets).

If your deployment relies on the location of these assets, you may need to update your caching configuration with your deployment platform.

### Changed: Markdown plugin configuration

#### Removed: `extendDefaultPlugins`

Astro 2.0 removes `markdown.extendDefaultPlugins`. Applying remark and rehype plugins **no longer disables** Astro's default plugins, so this option is no longer needed. 

GitHub-Flavored Markdown and Smartypants are now applied whether or not custom `remarkPlugins` or `rehypePlugins` are configured. (You can opt-out manually by setting [`gfm` and `smartypants`](#added-gfm-and-smartypants) to `false` in your config.)

You no longer need `extendDefaultPlugins: true` in your configuation. This is now Astro's default behavior in 2.0.

```diff
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
  markdown: {
-   extendDefaultPlugins: true,
  }
});
```

#### Added: `gfm` and `smartypants`

Astro 2.0 replaces `markdown.extendDefaultPlugins` with separate Boolean options to control each of Astro's built-in default plugins individually. These are enabled by default, and can be set to `false` to remove the plugin.

- `markdown.gfm: false` disables GitHub-Flavored Markdown
- `markdown.smartypants: false` disables SmartyPants

```diff
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
  markdown: {
-   extendDefaultPlugins: false,
+   smartypants: false,
+   gfm: false,
  }
});
```

### Changed: MDX plugin configuration

#### Removed: `extendPlugins`

Astro 2.0 removes the `mdx.extendPlugins` option to manage plugin defaults in MDX. This has been replaced by 3 flags:

- `mdx.extendMarkdownConfig` (`true` by default) to toggle Markdown config inheritance. This replaces the `extendPlugins: 'markdown'` option.
- `mdx.gfm` (`true` by default) to toggle GitHub-Flavored Markdown in MDX. This replaces the `extendPlugins: 'defaults'` option.
- `mdx.smartypants` (`true` by default) to toggle SmartyPants in MDX. This replaces the `extendPlugins: 'defaults'` option.

#### Added: `extendMarkdownConfig`

Astro 2.0 adds the Boolean [`mdx.extendMarkdownConfig`](/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/#extendmarkdownconfig) option to configure whether or not MDX should inherit your Markdown configuration. This option is `true` by default, and MDX options will default to their equivalent in your Markdown config. You no longer need `extendPlugins: 'markdown'` in your configuration for this behavior.

```diff
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
  mdx: {
-   extendPlugins: markdown,
  }
});
```

Replace `extendPlugins: defaults` with `extendMarkdownConfig: false` and use the individual options to enable GitHub-Flavored Markdown and SmartyPants if you want to inherit only Astro's default plugins, and not any other Markdown configuration options.

```diff
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
  mdx: {
-   extendPlugins: defaults,
+   extendMarkdownConfig: false,
+   smartypants: true,
+   gfm: true,
  }
});
```

#### Added: More MDX config options to match Markdown

Setting `extendMarkdownConfig` to false now allows you to individually set [every available Markdown configuration option](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#markdown-options) (except `drafts`) separately in your MDX integration config, including `syntaxHighlight`, `shikiConfig` and more.

```astro
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import mdx from '@astrojs/mdx';

export default defineConfig({
  markdown: {
    syntaxHighlight: 'prism',
    remarkPlugins: [remarkPlugin1],
    gfm: true,
  },
  integrations: [
    mdx({
      // `syntaxHighlight` inherited from Markdown

      // Markdown `remarkPlugins` ignored,
      // only `remarkPlugin2` applied.
      remarkPlugins: [remarkPlugin2],
      // `gfm` overridden to `false`
      gfm: false,
    })
  ]
});
```

### Added: Plugin access to frontmatter

Astro 2.0 gives remark and rehype plugins access to user frontmatter via frontmatter injection. This means `data.astro.frontmatter` is now the _complete_ Markdown or MDX document's frontmatter, rather than an empty object.

This allows plugin authors to modify existing frontmatter, or compute new properties based on other properties. For example, to compute a full image URL based on an `imageSrc` slug in your document frontmatter:

  ```ts
  export function remarkInjectSocialImagePlugin() {
    return function (tree, file) {
      const { frontmatter } = file.data.astro;
      frontmatter.socialImageSrc = new URL(frontmatter.imageSrc, 'https://my-blog.com/').pathname;
    };
  }
  ```

### Added: `src/content/`

In 2.0, the [Collections API is no longer hidden behind an experimental flag](#content-collections). This API reserves `src/content/` as a special folder. 

If you have an existing `src/content/` folder, it must be renamed to avoid conflicts. This folder can now only be used for [content collections](/en/guides/content-collections/).

## Astro 2.0 Experimental Flags Removed

Remove the following experimental flags from `astro.config.mjs`:

```diff
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
- experimental: { contentCollections: true },
- experimental: { prerender: true },
- experimental: { error-overlay: true },
})
```
In Astro v2.0, these features are no longer hidden behind an experimental flag and are all enabled by default.

### Content Collections

The experimental flag `--experimental-contentCollections` has been removed. The Colletions API is now available by default in Astro. 

See more about using [content collections in Astro](/en/guides/content-collections/).

TODO - Guide for converting to Content Collections, ideally!

### Prerendering

The experimental flag `--experimental-prerender` has been removed. The `prerender` feature is now enabled by default when using [`output:'server'`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#output). 

To prerender a particular page, add `export const prerender = true` to your frontmatter.

### Error overlay

The experimental flag `--experimental-error-overlay` has been removed. The error overlay during `astro dev` has a refreshed visual design and provides more context for your errors.
